In this exercice, you will learn how to install and configure a mysql database and a wordpress website using kubernetes helm.


In simple terms, Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes. Helm is the K8s equivalent of yum or apt. Helm deploys charts, which you can think of as a packaged application. 

It is a collection of all your versioned, pre-configured application resources which can be deployed as one unit. 



#Outcomes

You should be able to:
 - Install Helm
 - Use of a Chart
 - Deploy a MySQL database
 - Deploy a WordPress server

<b>Estimated time: 30 mins </b>
#Steps

Helm allows for easy deployment of complex configurations. This could be handy for a vendor to deploy a multi-part application in a single step. 

Through the use of a Chart, or template file, the required components and their relation-ships are declared. 

To fully grasp helm, there are 3 concepts we need to get familiar with:
   - Chart: A package of pre-configured Kubernetes resources.
   - Release: A specific instance of a chart which has been deployed to the cluster using Helm.
   - Repository: A group of published charts which can be made available to others.

1. Install Helm

   Run this command to download Helm
   ```
   wget https://get.helm.sh/helm-v3.0.0-linux-amd64.tar.gz
   ```
   Output should be
   ```
   helm-v3.0.0-linux-a 100%[===================>] 11.52M --.-KB/s in 0.1s
   2019-11-25 06:28:39 (112 MB/s) - ‘helm-v3.0.0-linux-amd64.tar.gz’ saved [12082866/12082866]
   ```
   Uncompress and expand the file.
   ```
   tar -xvf helm-v3.0.0-linux-amd64.tar.gz
   ```
   Copy the helm binary to the /usr/local/bin/ directory, so it is usable via the shell search path.
   ```
   sudo cp linux-amd64/helm /usr/local/bin/helm
   ```
   
2. Preparing Helm

   Once you have Helm ready, you can add a chart repository. One popular starting location is the official Helm stable charts:
   ```
   helm repo add stable https://charts.helm.sh/stable
   ```
   Make sure we get the latest list of charts
   ```
   helm repo update 
   ```
   Check that it's successfully added
   ```
   helm repo list
   ```
   Output should be
   ```
   NAME        	URL                                
   stable      	https://charts.helm.sh/stable  
   ```
3. Search for Charts
    
   A Chart is a collection of files to deploy an application. There is a good starting repo available on 
   https://github.com/kubernetes/charts/tree/master/stable, provided by vendors, or you can make your own. Search the current Charts in
   the Helm Hub or an instance of Monocular for available stable databases. Repos change often, so the following output
   may be different from what you see. 
   
   ```
   helm search hub mysql
   ```
   ```
   URL                                               	CHART VERSION	APP VERSION 	DESCRIPTION                                       
   https://hub.helm.sh/charts/bitnami/mysql          	8.2.3        	8.0.22      	Chart to create a HA MySQL cluster  
   https://hub.helm.sh/charts/t3n/mysql              	0.1.0        	8.0.22      	Fast, reliable, scalable, and easy 
   .
   .
   https://hub.helm.sh/charts/choerodon/mysql        	0.1.4        	0.1.4       	mysql for Choerodon https
  ```
4. Install MySQL database 
  
  In this section you will learn how to install and setup mysql in kubernetes cluster using helm.
  
  As you can notice, there are a list of parameters passed to "helm install" command. These parameters allow us to customize our solution before even installing it.
  
  For example, we've chosen a root password for MySQL using the variable "mysqlRootPassword". To keep things simple, we've chosen to disable persistence storage for the database.
  
  ```
  helm install mysql-database --set mysqlRootPassword=toor,persistence.enabled=false stable/mysql
  ```
  Output should be something like this
  ```
  WARNING: This chart is deprecated
  NAME: mysql-database
  LAST DEPLOYED: Fri Dec 18 02:23:09 2020
  NAMESPACE: default
  STATUS: deployed
  REVISION: 1
  NOTES:
  MySQL can be accessed via port 3306 on the following DNS name from within your cluster:
  mysql-database.default.svc.cluster.local
  
  To get your root password run:
  
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=$(kubectl get secret --namespace default mysql-database -o jsonpath="{.data.mysql-root-password}" | base64 --decode; echo)
  
  To connect to your database:
  
  1. Run an Ubuntu pod that you can use as a client:
  
      kubectl run -i --tty ubuntu --image=ubuntu:16.04 --restart=Never -- bash -il
  
  2. Install the mysql client:
  
      $ apt-get update && apt-get install mysql-client -y
  
  3. Connect using the mysql cli, then provide your password:
      $ mysql -h mysql-database -p
  
  To connect to your database directly from outside the K8s cluster:
      MYSQL_HOST=127.0.0.1
      MYSQL_PORT=3306
  
      # Execute the following command to route the connection:
      kubectl port-forward svc/mysql-database 3306
  
      mysql -h ${MYSQL_HOST} -P${MYSQL_PORT} -u root -p${MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD}
  ```
  You can check the entire list of available variables  on the chart's link on github:
  ```
  https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/wordpress
  ```
  Now, let's check what k8s objects have been created.
  ```
  kubectl get all
  ```
  Output
  ```
  NAME                                         READY   STATUS             RESTARTS   AGE
  pod/mysql-database-5bb86bb876-8h955          1/1     Running            0          3h15m
  
  NAME                            TYPE           CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)               AGE
  service/kubernetes              ClusterIP      10.96.0.1        <none>        443/TCP               12d
  service/mysql-database          ClusterIP      10.97.61.196     <none>        3306/TCP              3h15m
  
  NAME                                    READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
  deployment.apps/mysql-helm              1/1     1            1           3h15m
  
  NAME                                               DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
  replicaset.apps/mysql-helm-5bb86bb876              1         1         1       3h15m
  ```
  Then, let's get the exact ip address of the pod running the mysql database
  ```
  kubectl get pods -o wide
  ```
  Output
  ```
  NAME                                     READY   STATUS             RESTARTS   AGE     IP           NODE           
  mysql-database-5bb86bb876-8h955          1/1     Running            0          158m    10.32.0.10   worker-node1    
  ```
  Save this IP address of the mysql-database pod, we will need it later on.
  
5. Connect to the database via a mysql client

  Now, we will use a mysql client in order to connect to our previously created database.
  
  Let's create a mysql client using this command, remember to change the ip address to the one you found previously.
  ```
  kubectl run -it --image=mysql  mysql-client -- mysql -h<10.32.0.10> -P3306 -ptoor
  ```
  Output
  ```
  If you don't see a command prompt, try pressing enter.

  ```
  In order to check the list of avaialable databases, start typing this command:
  ```
  show databases;
  ```
  Output
  ```
  mysql> show databases ;
  +--------------------+
  | Database           |
  +--------------------+
  | information_schema |
  | mysql              |
  | performance_schema |
  | sys                |
  +--------------------+
  4 rows in set (0.00 sec)
  ```
  To create the database, you can use the following statement:
  ```
  CREATE DATABASE wordpress;
  ```
  Output
  ```
  Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)
  ```
  Now, let’s create a dedicated MySQL user for this database, feel free to choose a different password:
  ```
  CREATE USER wordpress_user IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
  ``` 
  ```
  Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
  ```
  The user wordpress_user was created, but it doesn’t have any access permissions yet. 
  
  The following command will give this user admin access (all privileges) to the wordpress database from both local and external networks:
  ```
  GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON wordpress.* TO wordpress_user@'%';
  ```
  ```
  Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.02 sec)
  ```
  Now you can exit the MySQL client with:
  ```
  exit;
  ```
  <!-- Because our WordPress installation will live on a separate server, we still need to edit our MySQL configuration to allow connections coming from external hosts.
  
  First, connect to a bash in your pod.
  ```
  kubectl exec -it mysql-client -- bash
  ```
  ```
  echo "bind-address            = 0.0.0.0" >> /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf
  ``` -->
5. Preparing WordPress

  Now that we have the necessary information to connect to the MySQL database, we can go ahead and install WordPress using Helm.

  By default, the WordPress chart installs MariaDB on a separate pod inside the cluster and uses it as the WordPress database. We want to disable this behavior and configure WordPress to use an external MySQL database. 
  
  This and other configuration options (such as the default WordPress admin user and password) can be set at installation time, either via command-line parameters or via a separate YAML configuration file.
  
  In order to keep things organized and easily extendable, we are going to use a configuration file.
  
  From your local machine, create a new directory for your project settings and navigate into it:
  
  ```
  mkdir myblog-settings; cd myblog-settings
  ```
  ```
  vi values.yaml
  ```
  ```
  ## Blog/Site Info
  wordpressUsername: sammy
  wordpressPassword: password
  wordpressEmail: sammy@example.com
  wordpressFirstName: Sammy
  wordpressLastName: the Shark
  wordpressBlogName: Sammy's Blog!
  
  ## Database Settings
  externalDatabase:
    host: mysql_server_ip
    user: wordpress_user
    password: password
    database: wordpress
  
  ## Disabling MariaDB
  mariadb:
    enabled: false
  ```
  Don't forget to change mysql_server_ip with the ip found in the previous steps.

6. Launch WordPress

  Now that we have all settings in place, it is time to execute helm to install WordPress. The following command tells helm to install the most recent stable release of the WordPress chart under the name myblog, using values.yaml as configuration file:
  ```
  helm install myblog -- set persistence.enabled=false -f values.yaml stable/wordpress  
  ```
  Then, let's get the port open on our host machine
  ```
  kubectl get services
  ```
  Output
  ```
  NAME                    TYPE           CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                      AGE
  kubernetes              ClusterIP      10.96.0.1        <none>        443/TCP                      12d
  myfirstblog-wordpress   LoadBalancer   10.110.14.44     <pending>     80:30171/TCP,443:32382/TCP   27s
  mysql                   ClusterIP      10.97.61.196     <none>        3306/TCP                     63m
  ```
  Access your wordpress page at 
  ```
  http://worker_node_ip:30171
  ```
  You should get a page like this
  <img src="images/1.png" width="1200" height="1200" />
